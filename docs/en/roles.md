### Role Distribution
[cite_start]The number of roles in play depends on the total number of players: [cite: 13]

* [cite_start]**4 players:** 1 Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 2 Outlaws. [cite: 13]
* [cite_start]**5 players:** 1 Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 2 Outlaws, 1 Deputy. [cite: 13]
* [cite_start]**6 players:** 1 Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 3 Outlaws, 1 Deputy. [cite: 13]
* [cite_start]**7 players:** 1 Sheriff, 1 Renegade, 3 Outlaws, 2 Deputies. [cite: 13]

!!! tip "Strategy"
    As a Deputy, don't be afraid to take a hit for your Sheriff. As an Outlaw, coordination with other outlaws (even if you don't know for sure who they are) is key to victory.
